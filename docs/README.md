## Docs

This is a temporary 'solution' to add some documentation about the project.

The two subdirectories sort some of the documents into end-`user` docs and `dev`eloper documentation.

I will attempt to include most documentation next to the code it lives so that it's more up to date, but some concepts are codebase-wide and don't belong in any one place.
